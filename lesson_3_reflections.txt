When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1) To collaborate with other users
2) To have access code files from all computers
3) Keep code files backuped up in GitHub (remote computer) 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If Git automatically pulls changes from remote repository, it might keep changing working copy of files and disturb your current work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: Creates a copy of repository of other developers in GitHub, so that we can track the origin of work.
Clones: Creating a copy of local repository or copy of own repository in GitHub.
Branches: Branch code in local repository to work on future releases, and parallel releases.
