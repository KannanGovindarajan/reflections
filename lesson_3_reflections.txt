When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1) To collaborate with other users
2) To have access code files from all computers
3) Keep code files backuped up in GitHub (remote computer) 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If Git automatically pulls changes from remote repository, it might keep changing working copy of files and disturb your current work.
